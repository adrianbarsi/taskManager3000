# TaskMaster3000
Capstone Project for Team10

## Introduction

TaskMaster is an entrepreneurial project designed by three Computer Programming students at Conestoga College. There are no clients associated with this project and all ideas and code have been originally created for this course.

TaskMaster is an efficient web app to keep track of employee work hours and day offs. It will be able to add new employees, allow them to punch in / out, and register time off. It will also allow managers to approve or reject time off.
